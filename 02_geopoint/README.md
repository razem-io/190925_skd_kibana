### Elasticsearch

There are several options to display points and lines on a map in Kibana. In this example we use normal coordinates for points and (GeoJson)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON] for lines.

The other options for points can be found here: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/geo-point.html

An advanced GeoJSON example can be found in chapter 03_geoshape.
